### Onyx
You can use it for dataflow style programming, it has a very data-driven API, and you can execute your workflows in the browser, on the backend, or even distributed over a zookeeper cluster. The fact that it's built primarily for the latter most of these cases means that the setup is a little more involved than simple cell computing usage in the ballpark of javelin, but I'd bet one could wrap the functionality up in some macros that make it more buttery for this purpose.
